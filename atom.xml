<p>In traditional cognition, there are eight categories of art, which are</p>
<ol>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Sculpture</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Drama</li>
<li>Film</li>
</ol>
<p>May 10, 2011, “the National Endowment for the Arts will be renaming its “Arts on Television and Radio” program “Arts in Media.” The new program will include grants for video-game creators, as well as for artists who create mobile and interactive platforms.” (<em>National Endowment For The &quot;ARTS&quot;, Including Video Games?</em> 2011)</p>
<p>This is tantamount to United State federal recognition of video games as “art,”</p>
<p>The video game became the ninth art.</p>
<p>This is the inevitable result. <strong>The universal law of the development of art is to give people a higher sense of the work of art.</strong> Games today are pushed to their limits in terms of production quality and budget,</p>
<p>Industry Analyst Michael Pachter estimated the development budget for the Red Dead Redemption 2 was between <strong>US$80 million</strong> and <strong>US$100 million</strong>. (Pachter, Red Dead Redemption 2 Cost To Make)</p>

<p>As the market develops and competition heats up, the game begins to have more demanding audience, carrying more advanced story, and more three-dimensional and diverse characters.</p>
<h4 id="role-play">Role Play</h4>
<p>Games have a unique advantage over other art forms in that you get feedback on your actions. This in itself is what games were designed for, to be &quot;played&quot;, and this advantage has given rise to the largest variety of games today:</p>
<p><code>RPG</code> Role-playing game</p>
<p>The protagonist Jacob Frye of Assassin's Creed Syndicate, games released by Ubisoft Quebec on November 19, 2015 is a bisexual.</p>

<p>And Ellie, The protagonist of Sony’s first party game studio Naughty Dog’s game, The Last of Us Part II, is a lesbian.</p>

<p>(The Last of Us Part II, playstation.com)</p>
<p>​	In 2007, the Stanford University Department of Communication began studying how the image of virtual characters in games influences gamers. Researchers Nick Yee and Jeremy Bailenson began to observe whether virtual character images affect players' behavior in the game.</p>
<p>In the experiment, players first ranked the character images according to their attractiveness. Each person was then assigned a character and talked to each other in a virtual scenario. The study found that players with more attractive personas behaved more confidently in their interactions, such as being more willing to approach other characters in the VR environment, or being more proactive in introducing themselves and inviting others to chat. (Brooks, 2021)</p>
<p>Games give players a chance to express themselves, which may help LGBTQ+ people become more confident in their lives. This phenomenon is known as the “Proteus effect”. The name comes from the Greek myth of a sea god who known for his ability to shape-shift.</p>
<p>If more LGBTQ+ role models emerged from all sectors of society, the LGBTQ+ community would feel more comfortable with their gender identity, a demand that can be met in video games because video game creators can create these types of characters and give players the ability to play a role.</p>

<h3 id="fictional-novels">Fictional Novels</h3>
<p>All adolescents inevitably grow up with objects to emulate. In other words, role models.</p>
<p>But for the LGBTQ+ community, finding a role model is difficult. Early on, they even grow up with criticism and negative opinions.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="5"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/AJR%20-%20Role%20Models%20(Official%20Video).png" alt="AJR-RoleModels(OfficialVideo)" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(AJR - Role Models, youtube.com)</p>
<p>Fictional novels provide a medium in which young people can find the same characters with LGBTQ+ characteristics. They can read the book and identify with the characters.</p>
<p>In a sample of 126 LGB young adults, the Internet and books were found to be the most inﬂuential media sources, although television and magazines were important as well (Gomillion &amp; Giuliano, 2011)</p>
<p>Positive character role models are important to the identity development of LGBTQ+ youth, and fiction is an important source of these character role models, but characters in LGBTQ+ fiction still have a tendency to be portrayed as tending toward highly emotional stereotypes. Grief, depression, emotional struggles, and even suicide remain staples of these works. Put another way, these gay novels are not &quot;love stories where the characters are gay,&quot; but rather &quot;gay love stories. It is also common to see same-sex couples appearing in novels in which one partner is portrayed as more masculine and one as more feminine.</p>
<p>The reason for this may be that a large percentage of LGBTQ+ authors are actually heterosexual themselves, and even if they are not discriminating or biased, they may be writing such content with more or less of a curiosity in mind. The only way to solve the problem is to encourage more LGBTQ+ authors to emerge and give a voice to this community.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-lgbtq-related-films-are-not-really-mainstream-yet-2">Why are LGBTQ-related films are not really mainstream yet?</h2>
<h3 id="movie-industry">Movie industry</h3>
<p>Most film production teams seem to be more focused on making a &quot;Homosexual movie&quot; that appeals to heterosexuals. Commercial interests drive the inclusion of LGBTQ elements to satisfy people's curiosity. At the same time, as society develops and acceptance increases, more and more people no longer consider non-binary sexuality a disease.</p>
<p>As a result, more of the LGBTQ community is choosing to embrace their identity and be open about it. So this is a two-sided topic. One side is that the studios are creating films on LGBTQ topics to interest and generate revenue from people who are curious about the topic.</p>
<p>Critics Trish Bendix raises a question, &quot;Did they adequately do marketing and outreach to core groups interested in the film?”(Bendix, 2018)</p>
<p>The answer may be not quite.</p>
<p>After poor sales in 815 theaters nationwide, Call Me By Your Name was taken out of more than 230 theaters in its second weekend of wide release, signaling that &quot;Sony is somehow not doing right by the film which has been widely well-received by critics and fans alike.&quot;(Bendix, 2018)</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="6"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Call-me-by-your-name-back.webp" alt="Call-me-by-your-name-back" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Call Me by Your Name, 2017)</p>
<p>On the other hand, studios don't really care about the opinions of LGBTQ+ people, and the decisions they make are largely based on financial considerations only. Although more film makers are willing to make this type of film, the profits that a company could get are usually less than average. This is definitely unacceptable for most companies because  their initial purpose was to attract more audience by these new kind of movies, not for LGBTQ+ people. That is the reason why &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; has been taken down.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="7"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Call-me-by-your-name-lay.webp" alt="Call-me-by-your-name-lay" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Call Me by Your Name, 2017)</p>
<p>These LGBTQ+ people are gradually becoming more and more acceptant as society develops, especially in movie industry. However, this type of film could not be the mainstream since a lot of countries still shows little tolerance towards this group of people. We believe the target audience of this movie should not be just LGBTQ+ people and there must exist people who are interested in this type of film only because they want to know more about this minority group and try to understand them. Moreover, film is a good way of expressing LGBTQ+ identity to the audience. Although this kind of movie still have a long way to go in order to become mainstream, we think the increasing number of this kind of film is encouraging for most people in the LGBTQ+ group.</p>

<h3 id="film">Film</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the story of <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>, the film by Luca Guadagnino. A sensual and transcendent tale of first love, based on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="8"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Call-me-by-your-name-poster.webp" alt="Call-me-by-your-name-poster" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(<em>Call Me by Your Name</em>, 2017)</p>
<p>Call Me By Your Name won the <strong>90th Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay</strong> and the <strong>Gotham Independent Film Awards</strong>, but the gross box office revenue is only 41.9 million U.S. dollars, a very mediocre market performance.</p>
<p>It’s Rotten Tomatoes score were 96%, with nearly 40,000 reviews, and a score of 9.1 on Douban, better than 99% of gay movies and 98% of love stories. These figures attest to the quality of the film itself</p>
<p>The commercial performance of the film does not match its quality.</p>
<p>The characters in this film do not deliberately create the image of homosexuality, but show a natural relationship without pathological and extreme elements. The audience can not stick to the homosexuality setting, but ignore the gender and simply feel the emotional fetters between the two people.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="9"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Call-me-by-your-name-watch.webp" alt="Call-me-by-your-name-watch" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Call Me by Your Name, 2017)</p>
<p>Director Luca Guadagnino himself is a homosexual, which is why this film is not a commercial film deliberately adding homosexual elements, but a natural love film. The ambiguity before love, the warmth after love and the bitterness of parting are the same regardless of gender. This work shows these plots without any prejudice.</p>
<hr>
<p>The same thing happened in the west of Wyoming. The silent farmer Ennis and the cheerful cowboy Jack met each other. They took a taboo step, fell deeply in love with each other, but were forced to have different families of their own.</p>
<p>When it comes to LGBTQ+ movies, Ang Lee's <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> is a mountain on flim history that can't be avoided. As Ang Lee's classic work, and the actor of one of the protagonists Heath Ledger, who became extremely famous after plays the role of the Joker in Batman Dark Knight Series, <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> has become a synonym for homosexuality to a certain extent, and its status is beyond doubt.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="10"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Brokeback%20Mountain-poster.webp" alt="BrokebackMountain-poster" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Brokeback Mountain, 2005)</p>
<p>The story of <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> takes place at a time when society was far less tolerant of LGBTQ + than it is today. In the secular high pressure, but to make the role of repression in the heart of the feelings of the more violent eruption. The contrast between the trepidation of hiding secrets in everyday life and the wildness of the exposed self is starkest.</p>
<p>The secret of <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>'s success is nothing more than a great love story with no gender preference, but it still indirectly affects Americans' views on homosexuality.</p>

<p>In 2008, five states in the United States legally recognized same-sex marriage, just three years after the film was released.</p>

<p>(Brokeback Mountain, 2005)</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, gay and lesbian teenagers were two to three times more likely to commit suicide than heterosexual teenagers, and homosexual teenagers account for 30 percent of all adolescent suicides. Homosexual identity formation could be less traumatic, however, if some explanation or rationalization of the adolescent’s feelings and behavior is provided (Siebler, 2010)</p>
<p>For a long time, LGBTQ+ groups have been ignored or demonized in all kinds of media. Nowadays, we have Gaystreaming TV stations like LOGO, A television station that specializes in providing LGBTQ+ content.</p>

<p>Furthermore, another remarkable achievement is gay movie Moonlight beat music movie La La Land at the Academy Awards ceremony and won the Oscar.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="14"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/04/19/SeAv8rjB9sT2Qyw.jpg" alt="moonlight" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Moonlight, 2016)</p>
<p>These examples shows that LGBTQ + films are gradually entering the mainstream film market, such a change challenges existing social and economic structures but also highlights the normality of homosexuality.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-audience-feel-about-lgbtq-related-media-2">How does the audience feel about LGBTQ-related media?</h2>
<h3 id="different-audiences">Different audiences</h3>
<p>We can divide the audience for LGBTQ-themed artworks into two parts. One segment is those who recognize LGBTQ people or are interested in LGBTQ culture. The other part of the audience is those who for some reason do not identify with or accept LGBTQ people. At the same time, there are many factors that influence the perception of a population as a whole, such as the influence of the government and the degree to which people are aware of new things.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="15"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/representation_media_img_1.png" alt="representation_media_img_1" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Considering about the government, government attitudes toward minorities can greatly influence how they are perceived, and censorship can influence whether people are homophobic. These points to the need to examine the originating forces of state homophobia and the extent to which the state selects for the nonexistence of homophobic practices and discourses or disproportionately exists in relation to the demands of sexual minorities. Indeed, in places where sexual minorities are unorganized or poorly organized, the choice of state actors, their allies and agents, may be to do nothing.</p>
<p>This is because of political, cultural, and other influences. That precedes sexual minority political organizing. This phenomenon compels us to ask, absent the need to treat any actual &quot;symptoms&quot; of alleged homosexual infection, why states succumb to a political Munchausen Syndrome by proxy? And that’s relate on human rights issues for LGBTQ people.</p>
<p>&quot;My approach to the globalization of LGBTQ identities is predicated on five interventions related to a hypothesis of convergence around human rights. First, convergence itself is best applied to state homophobia, though significant local differences remain related to variations in state capacity and governing coalitions, challenges to the state, as well as culture and history. These differences shape possible responses among sexual minorities, so that universal LGBTQ identities adapted from a US model by either state actors or sexual minorities are always somewhere over the rainbow.&quot;(Bosia,2013)</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="16"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/inclusive_language_img_2.png" alt="inclusive_language_img_2" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Similarly different generations have different views of LGBTQ people. The following section will mention the understanding and perception of LGBTQ works in the 1980s. This will help us better understand how people's perceptions have progressed and how society as a whole has changed dramatically in regards to LGBTQ people today compared to the 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the late 1980s, homosexuality was still depicted in films as confused people who did not conform to their gender identity. These marginalized characters showed young audiences what would happen to those who deviated from the heterosexual order. Negative examples were shown to the audience. Queers were often (mis)represented in cinema as confused youth who did not conform to their gender identity; boys who were not manly men and girls who were not womanly women. The transgressive protagonists were verbally and/or physically bullied by their classmates and teachers; they were often neglected by peers and families, being left to face exclusion and guilt.&quot; (Russo, 1981)</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="17"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/high-art-poster.jpg" alt="high-art-poster" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(<em>High Art</em>, 1998)</p>
<p>These marginalized characters show young audiences what will happen to anyone who deviates from the sexual order. The protagonist's homosexuality is rarely discussed. Instead, it is portrayed as a variety of gender anxiety disorder. &quot;For example, Vincent Minnellis Tea and Sympathy(USA 1956) presents Tom, an effeminate student in a boarding school, who is more sensitive and delicate than his abusive school-mates. At the end, older (and married) Tom visits his old school, and his sissy is understood as having been nothing more than a phase.&quot; (Russo, 1981)</p>

<p>他尝试闭上自己的眼睛，却发现自己根本没有感光器官</p>
<p>“我是……谁？我在哪？”</p>
<p>无数的疑问等待着解决，但是他却无法发出声音来。</p>
<p>环顾四周，他发现自己浸在一片白色乳液组成的海洋中</p>
<p>“这是……奶？”</p>
<p>片刻后，他意识到这是一个玻璃房的内部。</p>
<p>“冷静下来，我是谁，我到底是什么？”</p>
<p>这并没有提供任何帮助，因为他发现自己无法调出任何记忆，他唯一肯定的事情就是他的存在，仅仅因为他在思考。</p>
<p>他开始用排除法来确定自己是什么，</p>
<p>某种小虫子？它没法感知到任何器官的存在。</p>
<p>病毒？细菌？有可能，但是……</p>
<p>蛋白质？</p>
<p>蛋白质。</p>
<p>它难以置信，一个可以思考并且拥有常识的蛋白质？</p>
<p>连生物都不是，但是却可以用某种方式感知外界？</p>
<p>没有留给它太多思考的时间，一只巨大的手伸了过来，将同样巨大的玻璃房举起。</p>
<p>“我知道了，我是牛奶中的蛋白质，这个玻璃房是装牛奶的玻璃杯，而且我快要被喝下去了！”</p>
<p>宛如一场海啸，它被无数的水分、蛋白质、脂肪、乳糖裹挟着向着喉咙的深处挺进</p>
<p>“蛋白质有四级结构，要解开肽链后才能被消化，我在口腔的阶段应该还能保持完整” 蛋白质一边被口腔的温度加温一边想着。</p>
<p>它发现附近的唾液淀粉酶确实对他无动于衷，抬头看看，一个巨大的吊带挂在了口腔上方</p>
<p>“为了防止食物进入鼻腔的小舌（Uvula）吗，真是壮观。”</p>
<p>蛋白质进入了食道，朝着胃的方向一路前进，除了重力在拖着它和牛奶的其他部分一起下落外，食道中别的肌肉也在挪动尝试加速这个过程。</p>
<p>扑通一声，蛋白质落进了胃液，它感到一丝紧张，因为它知道胃蛋白酶要来了，胃酸使得蛋白质开始感到自己在发生微妙的变化，此时附近的胃蛋白酶被激活，开始消化蛋白质。</p>
<p>蛋白质不觉得痛，但是感到部分的自己正在变成氨基酸。时间一点一滴地过去，在蛋白质被完全消化成氨基酸之前，它随着食糜一起到了小肠。小肠里也有蛋白酶，但种类更多，还有肽酶。蛋白质感到水解又开始了，它逐渐变成氨基酸和小肽。</p>
<p>“原来这就是胰蛋白酶。”他想。</p>
<p>蛋白质已经不再是蛋白质了，它开始被肠纤毛吸收，一点点地进入这具身体的血管。</p>
<p>“我的旅程结束了” 它想。</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A dazzling light stung his eyes.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>He tried to close his eyes but found that he had no light-sensitive organs at all.<br>
&quot;I am ...... who? Where am I?&quot;<br>
Countless questions were waiting to be addressed, but he was unable to make a sound.<br>
Looking around, he found himself immersed in a sea of white<br>
&quot;Is this ...... milk?&quot;<br>
After a few moments, he realized that it was the interior of a glass room.<br>
&quot;Calm down, who am I and what am I really?&quot;<br>
This didn't provide any help, as he found himself unable to pull up any memories. The only thing he was sure of was his presence, simply because he was thinking.<br>
He began to use the exclusion method to determine what he was,<br>
Some kind of little bug? He couldn't sense the presence of any organ.<br>
A virus? A bacterium? Possibly, but ......<br>
Protein?<br>
Protein.<br>
It's unbelievable. A protein that can think and has common sense?<br>
Not even a living thing, but somehow able to sense the outside world?<br>
Without leaving it much time to think, a huge hand reached out and lifted up the equally huge glass room.<br>
&quot;I know, I'm the protein in the milk, this glass room is the glass that holds the milk, and I'm about to be drunk!&quot;<br>
Like a tsunami, the protein is swept up by countless water, protein, fat and lactose and pushes deep into the throat.<br>
&quot;Proteins have four levels of structure and have to unravel the peptide chain before it can be digested, I should still be intact at the oral stage.&quot; The protein thought as it was warmed by the temperature of the mouth.<br>
It found that the nearby salivary amylase was indeed indifferent to him, and looking up, a huge sling hung above the mouth<br>
“That’s uvula which use to keep food out of the nasal cavity? It's spectacular.&quot;<br>
The protein enters the esophagus and makes its way toward the stomach, and in addition to gravity dragging it down with the rest of the milk, other muscles in the esophagus are moving around to try to speed up the process.<br>
With a thud, the protein falls into the gastric juices and it feels a twinge of nervousness because it knows that pepsin is coming, and the stomach acid makes the protein start to feel like it is undergoing subtle changes.<br>
Nearby pepsin is activated and starts to digest the protein.<br>
The protein does not feel pain but feels that part of itself is turning into amino acids. Little by little, time passes, and before the protein is completely digested into amino acids, it goes to the small intestine with the chyme. There are proteases in the small intestine too, but there are more kinds and peptidases. The protein feels that hydrolysis has started again and it gradually turns into amino acids and small peptides.<br>
&quot;So this is trypsin.&quot; He thought.<br>
The protein is no longer protein, it begins to be absorbed by the intestinal cilia and little by little enters the blood vessels of this body.<br>
&quot;My journey is over,&quot; protein thought.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="导语">导语</h2>
<p><strong>Teambition</strong> 是阿里巴巴旗下工作学习套件，包含了从看板、网盘，到文档、日历等各式功能，个人使用免费。</p>
<p>其本质上是一款类 <strong>Trello</strong> 的任务管理看板应用，经过多年的迭代，从一个单纯的看板发展到如今的办公套件，发展路线和<strong>钉钉</strong>相似。事实上，这两款应用的确可以在日历等功能联动。除此之外，<strong>Teambition 网盘</strong>在与<strong>阿里网盘</strong>的内部竞争中宣告关闭，此后 <strong>Teambition</strong> 内部网盘功能也会直接接入阿里网盘。</p>
<p>作为<strong>钉钉</strong>和<strong>阿里网盘</strong>两款软件的重度用户，在比较了 <strong>Trello</strong> 和 <strong>Teambition</strong> 后还是选择了 <strong>Teambition</strong>，原因不外乎国内服务本地化更好以及访问更稳定。我自己能轻松访问国外服务不代表我的团队成员都拥有这个能力，而且能用<strong>钉钉</strong>账号登陆也是加分项。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Trello.png" alt="Trello" loading="lazy"></figure>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition.png" alt="Teambition" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="看板">看板</h2>
<p>新工具必然会伴随着学习成本，要熟悉 <strong>Teambition</strong> 首先就要熟悉其看板机制。</p>
<p>如果你用过待办事项 TO-DO 类的工具，熟悉看板的使用原理应该不成问题。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Microsoft-To-Do.png" alt="Microsoft-To-Do" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>想象多条 To-do list 横向排开，每一列都有着其对应的职能，而任务可以在不同的列之间随意拖动。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/List-example.png" alt="List-example" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>每个任务存在未完成与已完成的状态，可以被指派某个特定的执行人，可以添加截止时间、文档、备注等等。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="5"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Task-detail.png" alt="Task-detail" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="开始使用">开始使用</h2>
<p>创建你的第一个看板从建立一个「项目空间」开始。</p>
<p><strong>Teambition</strong> 提供了多种模版可供参考，以「团队日常」模版为例</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="6"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Team-routine.png" alt="Team-routine" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>项目根据团队成员的名字被区分成了「<strong>🙍 Alice</strong>」「<strong>🙎‍♂️ Ted</strong>」「」「<strong>🏄‍♂️ Jack</strong>」，每个人负责的任务被区分开来。</p>
<p>如果任务是以流水线形式完成，可以通过拖拽将任务移交给另一个负责人。</p>
<p><strong>Teambition</strong> 允许邀请他人加入项目进行合作，每个人的权限可以被单独设定。</p>
<hr>
<p>现在你已经对看板系统建立了初步的了解，接下来我将向你展示我是如何使用 <strong>Teambition</strong> 的看板系统构建自己的任务清单的。</p>
<p>我个人倾向于使用多个不同的项目空间来管理我的不同需求。</p>
<p>我常用的四个「项目空间」分别是：</p>
<p>「个人安排」「内容创作」「影视作品」「游戏世界」</p>
<h3 id="个人安排">「个人安排」</h3>
<p>我将需要完成的任务按照紧急程度划分为四个区域：</p>
<p>【<strong>Deadline</strong>】【<strong>Within a week</strong>】【<strong>Within a month</strong>】【<strong>Anytime</strong>】</p>
<p>如果你在上文任务详情部分观察足够仔细，你可能记得每个任务的详细设置中就可以设置任务优先级，但是我并不准备在这里进行设置，具体原因会在下文中解释。</p>
<p>根据每个任务紧急状态的变化，任务可以从最右边的最不紧急一路拖拽至最左边的最紧急。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="7"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Personal-arrangement.png" alt="Personal-arrangement" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>只要你关注过任务管理系统，你一定知道 <strong>GTD - Getting Things Done</strong> 时间管理系统</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="8"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/kwDfWE.png" alt="kwDfWE" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><strong>Teambition</strong> 非常适合用作 GTD 工具，但是我个人处理日常工作其实不需要一套如此详细的管理系统。</p>
<p>对我来说，根据项目 Deadline 划分的紧急程度优先级足够浅显易懂也更容易执行，将其以列表形式分组也避免了切换优先级时需要进入重新任务设置，拖动的操作更加直观也更符合直觉。</p>
<p>此外，因为打勾标记完成的任务会变灰沉底而不是直接删除，你还可以追踪哪些任务可以被提前完成，多少任务到了截止日才被完成，以此来改进自己的时间管理安排。</p>
<h3 id="内容创作">「内容创作」</h3>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="9"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Content-creation.png" alt="Content-creation" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>本项目的分类来自 <strong>Teambition</strong> 提供的模版。</p>
<p>你可以发现，「内容创作」的任务完成逻辑相比起「个人安排」有所不同。</p>
<p>任务被完成后不仅会被打勾标记完成，还会被移到**【创作完成】**分组。</p>
<p>对于这套根据任务状态而不是紧急程度的分组方式，所有被完成的任务会集中在同一分组下，方便管理与积累成就感，我也可以追踪每个任务的进度。</p>
<h3 id="游戏世界">「游戏世界」</h3>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="10"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Game-world.png" alt="Game-world" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h3 id="影视作品">「影视作品」</h3>
<p>本项目的分类逻辑与「游戏世界」基本相同，但是在视图上有着很大的区别。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="11"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Video-list.png" alt="Video-list" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>因为影单的分类通常较为固定，块之间不需要频繁的拖动，所以我使用了竖向视图。<br>
这样的排序方式更加传统，添加内容也更方便。由于我之前的片单分散在各大视频网站以及豆瓣，所以这个项目仍在施工中。</p>
<h3 id="单独项目">单独项目</h3>
<p>有时会有单个需要大量工作的 Project，这种情况可以考虑专门为单个 Project 创建项目</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="12"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-Inquiry.png" alt="Teambition-Inquiry" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>项目成员两名，开始时有五个任务。其中四个任务是研究课题，每人负责两个。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="13"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-note.png" alt="Teambition-note" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>为了方便整理资料，我将每个小课题所使用的参考文献和总结摘要放在了 <strong>Teambition</strong> 的笔记页。</p>
<p>所使用的文献资料可以直接上传到项目文件中</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="14"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-%20files.png" alt="Teambition-files" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>项目成员可以直接在 <strong>Teambition</strong> 中查看 PDF 并进行评论。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="15"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-%20document-%20preview.png" alt="Teambition-document-preview" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>为方便查阅，我也将参考文献与文档附在对应任务的备注和文件中。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="16"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-task-detail.png" alt="Teambition-task-detail" loading="lazy"></figure>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="17"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Teambition-task-file.png" alt="Teambition-task-file" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>这样就完成了一套完整的团队协作工作流，每个项目成员都能直观的了解任务目前的进度，并实时共享信息进行协作。</p>
<h2 id="后记">后记</h2>
<p><strong>Teambition</strong> 于 2018 年 4 月被阿里巴巴收购。</p>
<p>创始人@齐俊元 毕业于上海交通大学信息管理与信息系统专业，本人也已入驻少数派。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="18"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/Qi-Junyuan.png" alt="Qi-Junyuan" loading="lazy"></figure>

<h3 id="8-容器">8. 容器</h3>
<p>什么是容器？“容器”是存放您的文件的文件夹。容器保存一个笔记中使用的文本和其他资源。当然，您可以选择不使用容器。打开偏好设置-&gt; 基本-&gt; 容器并选择“无”。笔记将以纯文本、 Markdown 或 RTF 格式存储。</p>
<p>我建议对敏感数据使用 TextBundle 容器和加密 TextBundle 容器。请继续阅读</p>
<h4 id="textbundle-容器">TextBundle 容器</h4>
<p>文件扩展名 – <code>.textbundle</code></p>
<p>TextBundle – 这种格式旨在在应用程序之间交换纯文本文件(如 Markdown 或 RTF)时提供更无缝的用户体验。 http://textbundle.org</p>
<p>例如，一个 Markdown 文件可能包含对外部图像的引用。当从 Markdown 编辑器发送这样的文件到预览器时，用户必须明确指定每一个图像文件的位置。这就是 TextBundle 派上用场的地方。通过将 Markdown 文本和所有引用的图像打包在一个文件中，Text Bundle 提供更方便的体验。</p>
<h4 id="加密-textbundle-容器">加密 TextBundle 容器</h4>
<p>文件扩展名 – <code>.etp</code>.</p>
<p>加密文本包用于笔记加密。它是加密的文本包（压缩包）并用 RNCryptor 加密。RNCryptor 是一种跨平台的数据格式，有很多实现方案。在软件后台，我们有：</p>
<p>AES-256 加密<br>
CBC 模式<br>
PBKDF2 密码延伸<br>
密码加盐<br>
随机 IV<br>
加密后哈希 HMAC<br>
开放和跨平台</p>
<p>您可以使用 Python 或 Ruby、JS 等解密任何 FSNotes 笔记(完整列表可在此处找到)<br>
解压缩并用普通的文本格式快活吧。</p>

<p>“According to research done at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, following the guidelines presented through the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate can lead to a lower risk of heart disease and premature death.” (Akbaraly, 2011)</p>
<p>We, as nutritionists with extensive biological training and specializing in cell function and metabolism, can provide healthy food plan for the students on campus at Wenzhou High School No. 22, let students benefit from a healthy diet.</p>

<p>(<em>¿SABIAS QUE? ¿Qué son los Carbohidratos (CHO)?</em> 2020)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Carbohydrate is a kind of abundant nutrients existing in many foods and beverages. Carbohydrate can provide glucose for the body, which is converted into energy to support body function and physical activity. (<em>Carbohydrates.</em> 2019) In: fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals have more. (<em>Choose your carbs wisely.</em> 2020)</p>
<p>Examples: <code>rice</code>,  <code>noodle</code>,  <code>lotus</code>,  <code>root</code>, <code>potato</code>,  <code>taro</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Monomers of carbohydrates are simple sugars and the basic building blocks of carbohydrates, they are also known as monosaccharides and are used by the cells of living things to store and produce energy. (Achiyan, 2020)</p>
<p>Polysaccharides are large molecules composed of many smaller monosaccharides. Special enzymes combine these small monomers to form large sugar polymers or polysaccharides. (<em>Disaccharide.</em> 2019)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional group</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two functional groups in carbohydrates: carbonyl group and alcohol group. Generally speaking, we add Aldo - or keto - prefixes to carbohydrates to name carbonyl and alcohol functional groups. (<em>Nomenclature of Carbohydrates.</em> 2020)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemical properties</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Carbohydrates contain a lot of hydroxyl groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbohydrates are also structural components of cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbohydrates can combine with lipids and proteins.</p>

<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://gitee.com/marcuspierce/image-hosting-service/raw/master/uPic/H9Wsrk.jpg" alt="Protein" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>(Szalay, 2015)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Protein is a kind of macromolecule that is essential for muscle. It is commonly found in animal products, but it is also found in other sources such as nuts and beans. “Protein makes up about 15 percent of a person’s body weight.” (Szalay, 2015)</p>
<p>Examples: <code>beef</code>,  <code>lamb</code>,  <code>pork</code>,  <code>root</code>,  <code>milk</code>, <code>eggs</code>, <code>grain</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Proteins are made up of monomers called amino acids. They are linked together to form a polypeptide chain, which is folded into a three-dimensional structure to form a functional protein. (Embl-Ebi, <em>Biomacromolecular structures</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional group</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Proteins contain many functional groups. These functional groups include alcohols, thiols, thioethers, carboxylic acids, carboxamides, and a variety of basic groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemical properties</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Proteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of hydrolytic agents.</li>
<li>Proteins usually are almost neutral molecules, neither acidic nor basic properties.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-implement-it-in-the-school-cafeteria-2">How to implement it in the school cafeteria</h3>
<p>We encourage a healthy and balanced diet based on optimal proportions in school meals.</p>
<p>50% of a meal should be vegetables and fruits,</p>
<p>25% whole and intact grains, and 25% is made up of fish, poultry, beans and nuts.</p>
<p>There is an adequate supply of dietary fiber, carbohydrates and protein.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1月4日，本市无业游民吴某绑架了其前雇主袁某，并向袁某家属索要赎金十五万元。袁某家属放弃报警，承诺当天凑齐赎金。</p>
<p>随后，吴某为了安全收到赎金，进行了一系列迷之操作:</p>
<p>吴某指示袁某家属，于夜间十一点三十分在星河街路口等候（此处距离市中心较远，夜间路上几乎没有其他车辆行人），等到某外卖平台的骑手路过时，开车将其撞倒。趁现场混乱之际，将赎金和外卖箱中的餐品调换，以此完成支付赎金的环节；</p>
<p>为了避免引起外卖骑手的怀疑，吴某还让袁某家属提前点了一份外卖，并将标签上标有下单时间的部分撕毁，把剩余的部分标签绑在装有赎金的塑料袋上；吴某选定了外卖商家，星河街将是送餐的必经之路；</p>
<p>吴某利用虚假身份信息，租下了一栋居民楼八层和九层的两个房间，吴某将送餐地址定在九层，自己则躲在八层。一旦袁某家属偷偷报警，警方便不能在送餐地址所在的九楼将嫌疑人吴某抓捕归案。</p>
<p>当晚，嫌疑人吴某在约定时间到来之前点好外卖，之后也如同吴某所预想的一样，袁某家属成功在路口撞倒了骑手小李。</p>
<p>尽管骑手小李不是事故责任方，但是由于担心对方反过来让自己赔钱，于是强忍疼痛，迅速骑车逃离现场，继续送餐。为了避免收到差评，小李在与吴某和商家的沟通中，刻意隐瞒了此事。嫌疑人吴某收到外卖后，发现塑料袋中并不是赎金，猜测骑手小李偶然间看到了赎金并私自藏匿。</p>
<p>吴某当即对被绑的袁某进行殴打，用袁某掉下的一颗牙齿，威胁商家有食品卫生问题，要求骑手取回餐品重做，试图借此夺回赎金。</p>
<p>骑手小李因为身体不适，拒绝取餐，沟通一时陷入僵局。</p>
<p>这时，袁某家属通过短信和嫌疑人吴某取得联系，表明自己确实撞倒了骑手小李，但是因为小李逃得太快，袁某家属并没有完成调换赎金。</p>
<p>吴某指示袁某家属在原地等候，转头又打下了袁某更多的牙齿，试图以“疑似与命案有关”，恐吓骑手迅速回来取餐，了结此事。</p>
<p>但是吴某没有想到的是，小李经过权衡利弊，已经提前决定前去取餐。</p>
<p>精神高度紧张的吴某，想不到小李没打过招呼直接去了九层的送餐地址，匆匆跑上楼时，发现自己忘关了九层的房门，骑手小李已经看到了鲜血淋漓的袁某。</p>
<p>骑手小李还没从震惊中回过神，吴某迅速从背后袭击了小李，随后在小李的手机上，以对方的语气安抚外卖平台上的商家，声称此事已经结束。</p>
<p>草草处理过现场，吴某立刻骑上小李的电动车，赶往星河街路口。</p>
<p>一直等候在路口的袁某家属发现骑手重新出现，决定再次撞倒骑手，以便调换赎金解救袁某，不料这一次没控制好踩油门的力道，心急如焚的吴某被当场撞死……</p>

<h2 id="正文">正文</h2>
<h3 id="1-markdown是什么">1. Markdown<em>是什么</em>？</h3>
<p><strong>Markdown</strong>是一种轻量级<strong>标记语言</strong>，它以纯文本形式(<em>易读、易写、易更改</em>)编写文档，并最终以HTML格式发布。<br>
<strong>Markdown</strong>也可以理解为将以MARKDOWN语法编写的语言转换成HTML内容的工具。</p>
<h3 id="2-谁创造了它">2. <em>谁</em>创造了它？</h3>
<p>它由<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/"><strong>Aaron Swartz</strong></a>和<strong>John Gruber</strong>共同设计，<strong>Aaron Swartz</strong>就是那位于去年（<em>2013年1月11日</em>）自杀,有着<strong>开挂</strong>一般人生经历的程序员。维基百科对他的<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%9A%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E6%96%AF%E6%B2%83%E8%8C%A8">介绍</a>是：<strong>软件工程师、作家、政治组织者、互联网活动家、维基百科人</strong>。</p>
<p>他有着足以让你跪拜的人生经历：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>14岁</strong>参与RSS 1.0规格标准的制订。</li>
<li><strong>2004</strong>年入读<strong>斯坦福</strong>，之后退学。</li>
<li><strong>2005</strong>年创建<a href="http://infogami.org/">Infogami</a>，之后与<a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>合并成为其合伙人。</li>
<li><strong>2010</strong>年创立求进会（Demand Progress），积极参与禁止网络盗版法案（SOPA）活动，最终该提案被撤回。</li>
<li><strong>2011</strong>年7月19日，因被控从MIT和JSTOR下载480万篇学术论文并以免费形式上传于网络被捕。</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>年1月自杀身亡。</li>
</ul>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://github.com/younghz/Markdown/raw/master/resource/Aaron_Swartz.jpg" alt="Aaron Swartz" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>天才都有早逝的归途。</p>
<h3 id="3-为什么要使用它">3. <em>为什么</em>要使用它？</h3>
<ul>
<li>它是易读（看起来舒服）、易写（语法简单）、易更改<strong>纯文本</strong>。处处体现着<strong>极简主义</strong>的影子。</li>
<li>兼容HTML，可以转换为HTML格式发布。</li>
<li>跨平台使用。</li>
<li>越来越多的网站支持Markdown。</li>
<li>更方便清晰地组织你的电子邮件。（Markdown-here, Airmail）</li>
<li>摆脱Word（我不是认真的）。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-怎么使用">4. <em>怎么</em>使用？</h3>
<p>如果不算<strong>扩展</strong>，Markdown的语法绝对<strong>简单</strong>到让你爱不释手。</p>
<p>Markdown语法主要分为如下几大部分：<br>
<strong>标题</strong>，<strong>段落</strong>，<strong>区块引用</strong>，<strong>代码区块</strong>，<strong>强调</strong>，<strong>列表</strong>，<strong>分割线</strong>，<strong>链接</strong>，<strong>图片</strong>，<strong>反斜杠 <code>\</code></strong>，<strong>符号'`'</strong>。</p>
<h4 id="41-标题">4.1 标题</h4>
<p>两种形式：<br>
1）使用<code>=</code>和<code>-</code>标记一级和二级标题。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>一级标题<br>
<code>=========</code><br>
二级标题<br>
<code>---------</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="一级标题">一级标题</h1>
<h2 id="二级标题">二级标题</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>2）使用<code>#</code>，可表示1-6级标题。</p>
<blockquote>
<p># 一级标题<br>
## 二级标题<br>
### 三级标题<br>
#### 四级标题<br>
##### 五级标题<br>
###### 六级标题</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="一级标题-2">一级标题</h1>
<h2 id="二级标题-2">二级标题</h2>
<h3 id="三级标题">三级标题</h3>
<h4 id="四级标题">四级标题</h4>
<h5 id="五级标题">五级标题</h5>
<h6 id="六级标题">六级标题</h6>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="42-段落">4.2 段落</h4>
<p>段落的前后要有空行，所谓的空行是指没有文字内容。若想在段内强制换行的方式是使用<strong>两个以上</strong>空格加上回车（引用中换行省略回车）。</p>
<h4 id="43-区块引用">4.3 区块引用</h4>
<p>在段落的每行或者只在第一行使用符号<code>&gt;</code>,还可使用多个嵌套引用，如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; 区块引用<br>
&gt;&gt; 嵌套引用</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>区块引用</p>
<blockquote>
<p>嵌套引用</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="44-代码区块">4.4 代码区块</h4>
<p>代码区块的建立是在每行加上4个空格或者一个制表符（如同写代码一样）。如<br>
普通段落：</p>
<p>void main()<br>
{<br>
printf(&quot;Hello, Markdown.&quot;);<br>
}</p>
<p>代码区块：</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    printf(&quot;Hello, Markdown.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>注意</strong>:需要和普通段落之间存在空行。</p>
<h4 id="45-强调">4.5 强调</h4>
<p>在强调内容两侧分别加上<code>*</code>或者<code>_</code>，如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*斜体*，_斜体_<br>
**粗体**，__粗体__</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>斜体</em>，<em>斜体</em><br>
<strong>粗体</strong>，<strong>粗体</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="46-列表">4.6 列表</h4>
<p>使用<code>·</code>、<code>+</code>、或<code>-</code>标记无序列表，如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-（+*） 第一项<br>
-（+*） 第二项<br>
- （+*）第三项</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>注意</strong>：标记后面最少有一个_空格_或_制表符_。若不在引用区块中，必须和前方段落之间存在空行。</p>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>第一项</li>
<li>第二项</li>
<li>第三项</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>有序列表的标记方式是将上述的符号换成数字,并辅以<code>.</code>，如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 . 第一项<br>
2 . 第二项<br>
3 . 第三项</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>第一项</li>
<li>第二项</li>
<li>第三项</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="47-分割线">4.7 分割线</h4>
<p>分割线最常使用就是三个或以上<code>*</code>，还可以使用<code>-</code>和<code>_</code>。</p>
<h4 id="48-链接">4.8 链接</h4>
<p>链接可以由两种形式生成：<strong>行内式</strong>和<strong>参考式</strong>。<br>
<strong>行内式</strong>：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[younghz的Markdown库](https:😕/github.com/younghz/Markdown &quot;Markdown&quot;)。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown" title="Markdown">younghz的Markdown库</a>。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>参考式</strong>：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[younghz的Markdown库1][1]<br>
[younghz的Markdown库2][2]<br>
[1]:https:😕/github.com/younghz/Markdown &quot;Markdown&quot;<br>
[2]:https:😕/github.com/younghz/Markdown &quot;Markdown&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown" title="Markdown">younghz的Markdown库1</a><br>
<a href="https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown" title="Markdown">younghz的Markdown库2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>注意</strong>：上述的<code>[1]:https:://github.com/younghz/Markdown &quot;Markdown&quot;</code>不出现在区块中。</p>
<h4 id="49-图片">4.9 图片</h4>
<p>添加图片的形式和链接相似，只需在链接的基础上前方加一个<code>！</code>。</p>
<h4 id="410-反斜杠">4.10 反斜杠<code>\</code></h4>
<p>相当于<strong>反转义</strong>作用。使符号成为普通符号。</p>
<h4 id="411-符号">4.11 符号'`'</h4>
<p>起到标记作用。如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`ctrl+a`</p>
</blockquote>
<p>效果：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ctrl+a</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="5-谁在用">5. <em>谁</em>在用？</h4>
<p>Markdown的使用者：</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>简书</li>
<li>Stack Overflow</li>
<li>Apollo</li>
<li>Moodle</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>等等</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-尝试一下">6. 尝试一下</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome</strong>下的插件诸如<code>stackedit</code>与<code>markdown-here</code>等非常方便，也不用担心平台受限。</li>
<li><strong>在线</strong>的dillinger.io评价也不错</li>
<li><strong>Windowns</strong>下的MarkdownPad也用过，不过免费版的体验不是很好。</li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>下的Mou是国人贡献的，口碑很好。</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>下的ReText不错。</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>当然，最终境界永远都是笔下是语法，心中格式化 😃。</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>注意</strong>：不同的Markdown解释器或工具对相应语法（扩展语法）的解释效果不尽相同，具体可参见工具的使用说明。<br>
虽然有人想出面搞一个所谓的标准化的Markdown，[没想到还惹怒了健在的创始人John Gruber]<br>
(http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/ )。</p>
<hr>
<p>以上基本是所有traditonal markdown的语法。</p>
<h3 id="其它">其它：</h3>
<p>列表的使用(非traditonal markdown)：</p>
<p>用<code>|</code>表示表格纵向边界，表头和表内容用<code>-</code>隔开，并可用<code>:</code>进行对齐设置，两边都有<code>:</code>则表示居中，若不加<code>:</code>则默认左对齐。</p>
